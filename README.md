# JS-Game-Challenge

This is my first JS Game, so I chose a very easy-to-build one: a grid-based memory game for kids with "Hello Kitty" cards. If this works out fine, I will try to build a more advanced game.

In this game you have to flip over 2 cards out of a grid of 16 cards, and if they match it's 1 point for the player, and the cards are taken off the board. The game is over, when all cards flipped over matched.

Original Challenge description below:

JavaScript Game
The task
Congratulations, you’re a JavaScript developer! Now it’s time to show the world your newly
discovered powers!
You need to put everything you’ve learned in your first 3 weeks to the test by designing and
building your own full functioning browser based game using HTML, CSS/SCSS and
JavaScript.....
You have a few options to choose from depending on your confidence level with JavaScript.
If you are not sure what to choose message a coach and they can always guide you.
Previous trainees have built a wide variety of things, including:  
• Tic Tac Toe
• Connect Four
• Point and Shoot games
• Minesweeper
• Quizzes and Trivia (e.g. Who Wants to be a Millionaire)

Here are some examples for you from previous students, showing a range of difficulty:
• A Quiz Game https://js-quiz-git-master-jakealistairwood.vercel.app/
• Space Invaders https://johnguilding.dev/project_space_invaders/
• 2048 (hard) https://oliblack.github.io/game-project/
• Hangman https://manuelare.github.io/hangman-game/#game
• Keyboard Invaders! https://www.martinharrison.dev/Keyboard-invaders/

Start simple and add new features afterwards!
The end goal here is to have your own game that works and also pushes your understanding
of JavaScript.
Let’s build!
We’re aiming for the following goals for this project:

1. A working Game: The main task is to create a Game not only will this test your
   understanding of JavaScript but how you break down a problem.
2. Practice using Git and GitHub flow: We want you to get as much practice as possible
   using git, GitHub and the command line. (We are upping the stakes... 25 commits)
3. Apply what you are learning: This is a great place to apply what you have been
   learning on all of the course so far. When you get it functioning really push on the UI,
   use SCSS, BEM, anything else you find on the web....really go mad!
4. Be aware: Collision detection is infamously difficult in JS so try to avoid this.

Requirements
• PSEUDOCODE: Do it. Trust me, you will thank yourself. Feel free to check this with a
coach before starting to code if you have any questions on approach.
• You need to have it as a public repository on GitHub
o In the repo you will also need a README.md with a short intro to the project.
• You must have at least 25 Git commits for the project and repo on GitHub
• Your JS code must be formatted as functions or Classes!
• You must use click or keypress events in JavaScript to trigger the events in the
game. (No refreshing to start the game again!!)
• Beware of following a “How to make a game in JS tutorial”. Watching a video is not
the same as learning to code. Some of the stuff you’ll have to do we won’t have
covered so If you can’t explain it or don’t understand it, you can’t use it. You are only
cheating yourself... so don’t...
• We would like you to take a Mobile first approach to the implementation. It needs to
work on different device widths.
• Add a link to this project on your portfolio – this is your first chance to really show off
your web skills!
